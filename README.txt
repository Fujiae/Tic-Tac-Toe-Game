# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. 
The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are marked and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
